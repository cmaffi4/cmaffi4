# Hello everyone!

I'm Claudio, nice to e-meet you! I love to travel and know new cultures. I'm passionate of Data Science and Statistics.

Last February I gained a MSc in Data Science at University of Milano-Bicocca, and I'm looking for new working experiences!

Here you will find some of the projects that I faced during my studies. Moreover, you will find a copy of my Master Thesis and the abstract of the project that I developed at Honda Research Institute located in Offenbach am Main, Germany.
